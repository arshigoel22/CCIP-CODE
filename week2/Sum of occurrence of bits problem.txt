                       Sum of occurrence of bits problem 
Ravi & Reema got a task to find number of 1’s & 0’s respectively as 'n1’ & ‘n2’ in the 
binary representation of a number. Both perform their tasks independently and at the end 
to show their team work they share their outputs and find the sum of both the outputs.

Input Format

Constraints

1 <= n <= 3000

Output Format

Print the sum of ‘n1’ & ‘n2’
