                            Even-Odd Roll Numbers 

In a class there can be ’n’ students, whose roll numbers starts
 from zero ’0’. Two practicals assigned to all the students such 
that all the students with even roll number will do practical 1 
and with odd roll numbers do practical 2.

Marks alloted to each student and store in the form of 
We need to find the absolute difference between the average marks
 of students with even roll number & odd roll numbers.

Input Format

Accept marks of ‘n’ students.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 50 1 <= marks <= 100

Output Format

Print the absolute value of difference of averages
